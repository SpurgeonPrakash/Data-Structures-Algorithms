In this problem, first I have created a set for making union & intersection of the two linked list. Then I have created a new linked list from the set.


Time Complexity:

union: O(s1+s2) where s1 is the number of elements in the first set and s2 is the number of elements in the second set -basically O(n) where n is the size of the input-
intersection: O(n) where n is the longer of the 2 lists.

Space Complexity:

union and intersection: O(n) where n is the size of the input (llist_1 + llist_2)
